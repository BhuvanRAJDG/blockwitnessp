📌 Build a full-stack project called “BlockWitness”

I want you to generate a complete, clean, easy-to-understand implementation of a tamper-proof digital evidence recorder called BlockWitness.

Use Node.js + Express + SQLite for backend and HTML + CSS + JS (no React) for frontend so it stays inside Replit limits.

🎯 Functional Requirements
1. Evidence Upload + Report System

Upload files (image/video/docs)

Compute SHA-256 hash of each file

Store file + hash + metadata locally

Generate report ID and block ID

2. Blockchain Simulation

Implement a simple blockchain with:

index

previous_hash

merkle_root

timestamp

transactions (list of evidence items)

block_hash (SHA-256 of block payload)

RSA/ECDSA signature of block_hash

Store all of this in SQLite.

3. Merkle Tree

Build Merkle tree from file hashes

Store merkle_root inside block

Provide helper to verify file → merkle proof

4. Verification Page

User uploads a file →
Compute SHA-256 → compare with stored hashes →
If match → show:

matched block index

block hash

merkle root

signature valid / invalid

If mismatch → show File Modified ❌.

5. User Interface

Build 3 pages:

/ → Create Report

/explorer → Block explorer list

/verify → Verify file authenticity

All pages must use:

colors: red, royal blue, green, black, white + bright gradients

best animations: smooth fade-in, slide-up, hover glow, button pulse

smooth transitions

clean modern cards and buttons

Make UI:

very interactive

minimal

mobile responsive

NO React, only pure HTML/CSS/JS.

6. Animations Required

card hover lift

gradient background animation

glowing buttons

file-preview fade-in

block explorer smooth accordion expand

7. Output Requirements

Create clean folder structure:

/public
   |– style.css
   |– script.js
/server
   |– blockchain.js
   |– merkle.js
   |– db.js
   |– signer.js
   |– routes.js
index.js


Write extremely clean code with comments

Keep logic simple and readable

Everything must run directly on Replit without extra configuration

8. Technical Logic Summary (for Replit agent clarity)

Follow EXACTLY this sequence:

When report is created:

Save uploaded files to /uploads

For each file:

read bytes

compute SHA-256

Build Merkle tree → merkle_root

Create block payload:

{
  index,
  prev_hash,
  merkle_root,
  timestamp,
  transactions
}


Compute block_hash = SHA256(payload)

Sign with RSA/ECDSA private key

Insert into SQLite:

block info

transactions

signature

For Verification:

Upload file

Compute SHA-256

Search evidence table

If found → display block + signature verification

If not found → show “Modified ❌”

9. Deliverables

Fully working backend

Fully designed colorful UI

All animations included

Clean code comments
